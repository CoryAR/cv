  Hello, my name is Cory Roberts. I've been in web development for over a decade. All of my web development expertise has mainly been used on message board services. I've been a part of two major message board services (ZetaBoards and Jcink), offering support and coding assistance/resources for a very long time. I'm wanting to pursue an actual career in web development.
